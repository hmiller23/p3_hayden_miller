        Frenkie has been my favorite soccer player for a number of years now. I
        love the energy he plays with as well as his overall play style. Over
        the past number of months I have really analyzed the way he has played
        and hopefully I have the opportunity to implement his play style into my
        game.

        Nick Kyrgios is by far my favorite tennis player on the planet because
        of his unorthodox play style. There is never a boring moment when Nick
        is on the court. I have 100% mimicked my play style around him and
        attempt to do all of his cool tricks on court.

        Aaron Donald is not only my favorite player in the NFL but in my
        opinion, he is also the best player in the entire league. He is so fun
        to watch and is an absolutely incredible athlete. I love being a rams
        fan but he makes it even more enjoyable.
