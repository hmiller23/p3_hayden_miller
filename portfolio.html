    <h1>Traffic Light Sketch</h1>

    <h2> Welcome to my Traffic Light sketch. Watch the colors of the lights switch just as a real traffic light would.<h2>
  </body>
  <h3> In this sketch there is a traffic light that automatically changes colors. Look out for the yellow light which changes colors more quickly than the other lights. The lights will change on thier own and the next light will immediately turn on. Enjoy watching this fun sketch :)
