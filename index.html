    My programming experience has been very interesting and exciting. I joined
    the class because I had heard from so many different people that one thing
    they had wished they had done in school was programming. I decided this
    class would be the perfect opportunity to try it out. At first, I was
    finding it very easy and liked doing all of the projects. The coding
    however, became slightly more difficult as the projects became more complex
    and I had to use all of the tools I had available to complete the
    assignments. However, I was able to get more comfortable with the more
    difficult assignments and feel overall more confident in my programming
    ability. I hope the skills I have learned and will continue to learn can
    help me with many aspects of life including helping designing a website as
    well as other digital products.
